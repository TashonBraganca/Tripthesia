- [ ] **[BIZ-002]** Currency Handling: Mixed INR/USD handling without proper conversion rates
- [ ] **[BIZ-003]** Usage Limits: Race conditions in usage increment logic can allow exceeding limits

**Phase 2C Completion Criteria**: ✅ **85% COMPLETE** - Standardized API error handling with comprehensive error responses, advanced loading states with progress tracking and retry logic, comprehensive form validation with step progression, error boundary system with recovery options. User experience significantly enhanced with proper error handling and validation.

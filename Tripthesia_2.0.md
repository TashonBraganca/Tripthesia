- [x] **[FE-002]** Memory Leaks: Fixed useCallback and dependency array issues in React hooks ✅
- [ ] **[FE-003]** State Management: TripData interface uses `any` types masking potential runtime bugs
- [ ] **[FE-004]** Data Persistence: Page refresh loses all form data - no localStorage backup
- [ ] **[FE-005]** Error Boundaries: Missing error boundaries for component failures - entire app crashes on errors

### 🔄 Caching & Performance
- [ ] **[CACHE-001]** Cache Key Collisions: Floating point precision issues in `lib/redis.ts:99-102` cache keys
- [ ] **[CACHE-002]** Cache Invalidation: No proper cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] **[CACHE-003]** Redis Failover: Mock Redis behavior inconsistent with real Redis implementation
- [ ] **[CACHE-004]** No Compression: Large cache values not compressed affecting performance

**Phase 2B Completion Criteria**: ✅ **95% COMPLETE** - Database schema enhanced with foreign keys, constraints, and comprehensive indexing. React hooks dependency issues fixed. Multi-level caching strategy implemented with Redis and memory cache. Performance optimizations complete. TypeScript compilation errors resolved.

## 🎨 PHASE 2C: USER EXPERIENCE & POLISH (WEEK 3)
**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM | **Status**: ⏳ Pending | **Target**: Week 3

### 🔌 API & Backend Reliability
- [ ] **[API-001]** Error Handling: Inconsistent error responses across endpoints - standardize error format
- [ ] **[API-002]** Request Logging: Using console.error instead of proper structured logging
- [ ] **[API-003]** Timeout Handling: No request timeout configurations for external API calls
- [ ] **[API-004]** Pagination: Hard-coded limits without proper pagination in `app/api/trips/route.ts:191`
- [ ] **[API-005]** Date Timezone: Date timezone handling issues in trip creation and validation

### 🎨 User Interface & Experience
- [ ] **[UX-001]** Loading States: Missing loading indicators between form steps causing user confusion
- [ ] **[UX-002]** Form Validation: No validation before allowing step progression - users can skip required fields
- [ ] **[UX-003]** Mobile Responsiveness: Complex forms not properly tested on mobile devices
- [ ] **[UX-004]** Accessibility: Missing ARIA labels and screen reader support throughout app
- [ ] **[UX-005]** Error Recovery: No way to recover from failed form submissions

### 💰 Business Logic Issues
- [ ] **[BIZ-001]** Subscription Validation: Pro route check only sets header but doesn't actually validate subscription in `middleware.ts:48-56`
- [ ] **[BIZ-002]** Currency Handling: Mixed INR/USD handling without proper conversion rates
- [ ] **[BIZ-003]** Usage Limits: Race conditions in usage increment logic can allow exceeding limits

**Phase 2C Completion Criteria**: Polished user experience, proper form validation, mobile-responsive design, business logic validation.

Below is a single, copy‑paste prompt for Cloud Code. Save it as BUGS_FIX.md at the repo root. This one file is the plan and the live progress log. Cloud must append results under the “Progress Log” section after every step, checking items off as they pass acceptance. No other docs.

Tripthesia — Phase 1 UI/UX Reboot (Single-File Plan + Live Log)

Operating rules
- Scope: Phase 1 is UI/UX only for marketing landing, auth/loading, and the post‑sign‑in home (/trips) + “Create New Trip” inputs and stepper behavior. No database schema changes beyond simple profile fields; no new bookings logic.
- Style direction: Replace purple with a deep blue + green palette. Add animated topographical line background. Centralized Vercel‑style hero with no “AI” in copy. Add subtle travel‑icon micro‑motion. Use React Bits components for backgrounds/FX.
- Fonts: Headings = a clean serif (Source Serif 4 or Merriweather). Body/UI = neutral sans (Inter/Geist). Ensure WCAG AA contrast in both themes, with dark‑first look.
- Model usage: Default to GPT‑5 Nano for lightweight reasoning (normalization, copy variants, UI labels). Escalate only if needed. Tool‑first behavior; never hallucinate data.
- Compliance: If any Google Places data is rendered (ratings/photos), display it only on a Google map; prefer partner or Foursquare content for Mapbox contexts.
- Single file: Keep all planning and progress in BUGS_FIX.md. After each task, append a log entry under “Progress Log” with PASS/FAIL, screenshots/metrics. If something fails three times, mark NEEDS HUMAN with suspected root cause.

Color and motion tokens (visual constraints to use everywhere)
- Color tokens:
  - Navy 900: #061A2C
  - Navy 800: #0A2540
  - Teal 500: #15B37D
  - Teal 400: #22C692
  - Sky 400: #18BDD6
  - Sand 100 (subtle text on dark): #B8C7D3
  - On‑dark text primary: #E6F0F8
  - On‑dark text secondary: #A8C0CF
  - Error: #FF6B6B
- Backgrounds:
  - Dynamic topography lines (slow parallax drift)
  - Bento grid hover highlights (subtle glass/blur)
  - No purple anywhere
- Motion:
  - 150–200 ms micro interactions; 300–500 ms section reveals
  - Reduced‑motion safe fallbacks
- Icons: thin‑stroke travel set (plane, map pin, compass, hike, rail, road, bed)

Navigation and IA rules (Phase 1)
- Marketing top bar: Logo left, centered nav minimalism: Trips, Pricing. Remove “How it Works” and “Features” from nav. Right: Sign in + Start Planning.
- Authenticated top bar: Same placement and sizing. Right: “Welcome, {FirstName}” chip (not email) with avatar dropdown; currency selector if already present.

Tasks (do in order; each has acceptance criteria and test devices)

Task 0 — Baseline crawl and snapshot (max 45 min)
- Crawl: /, /trips, /new, /trip/[id] (sample if exists), /saved, /billing, /s/[token], /404.
- Record: titles, metas/OG, headings, all interactive elements, console/network errors.
- Lighthouse mobile+desktop: capture LCP/CLS/TTI per route. Axe accessibility pass.
- Post “before” screenshots (desktop + Android Chrome Pixel 6 dark).
Acceptance:
- BUGS_FIX.md updated with route inventory and core metrics table under Progress Log → Baseline. Screenshots linked. Any critical errors called out.

Task 1 — Replace landing hero with topographical, center‑stacked Vercel‑style layout
- Remove stock photo on the hero. Center title and subhead; remove “AI” from all marketing copy on the landing.
- Title (center): “Plan your perfect trip in minutes.” Sub: “Live prices, real hours, and a planner that adapts to you.”
- Colors: dark blue → teal gradient; animated topographical lines (slow drift). Use React Bits background primitives for topography effect.
- Add a small orbit of travel icons (map pin, plane, hiker) with slow pathing around the headline. Respect reduced‑motion.
- Primary CTA: Start Planning (solid Teal 500); Secondary: View Examples (outline).
- Keep top bar fixed; hero content scrolls under.
Acceptance:
- No purple; hero centers on all breakpoints; background animates smoothly at <3% CPU idle on desktop; Lighthouse CLS < 0.1; copy contains no “AI”.

Task 2 — Serif/sans typography and contrast overhaul
- Headings: Source Serif 4 (or Merriweather) with proper weights; Body/UI: Inter/Geist.
- Verify contrast of all text on dark backgrounds meets AA (titles ≥ 3:1, body ≥ 4.5:1). Fix the white input background issue in dark theme (especially in the wizard).
- Standardize spacing: 8px grid; radii sm=6, md=10, lg=14.
Acceptance:
- No white‑on‑white or low‑contrast fields. Axe shows zero color‑contrast violations on / and /new.

Task 3 — New loading experience: bouncing GPS pin
- Replace generic spinner with a minimal “map pin bouncing on a faded mini‑map” animation for all async gates (auth redirect, planner initial generation).
- Keep animation under 3s loops; provide paused/static fallback for reduced‑motion.
Acceptance:
- All auth and initial planner loads show the new animation. No layout shift. CPU < 5% on desktop during idle loop.

Task 4 — Sign‑in stability and session continuity
- Ensure Clerk sessions render on server without flash: SSR reads session and passes down; no “Logged out → in” flicker on /trips or /new.
- After Google sign‑in, redirect back to the intended page. Create or upsert profile row with firstName/lastName and currency on first login.
- Keep users signed in across navigations/tabs and on refresh. Disable caching on authenticated pages that caused stale sessions.
Acceptance:
- Chrome, Safari, Android Chrome, iOS Safari: no auth flicker; refresh on /trips stays signed in; profile firstName visible in header chip.

Task 5 — Authenticated home (/trips) visual and copy refresh
- Keep theme/colors consistent with landing. Header right shows “Welcome, {FirstName}” with subtle shimmer on first paint. Under header: rotating one‑liner that cycles through travel vibes (“city breaks”, “treks”, “food hunts”) every 6s.
- Quick actions row: Create New Trip, Browse Destinations, Resume Last Trip. Cards have travel icon, short subcopy, keyboard focus states.
- Stats row (optional): trips planned, countries covered, current plan tier.
- Empty state: hero illustration (map pin on topo lines), big CTA “Create Your First Trip.”
Acceptance:
- The page visually matches landing styling; keyboard tab order sane; Create New Trip CTA prominent and passes a11y.

Task 6 — Wizard: From/To omnibox with countries + states + cities + airports + stations
- Replace current inputs with a grouped omnibox:
  - Groups: Airports (IATA), Cities, States/Regions, Countries, Rail Hubs, Bus Terminals.
  - Each item shows name, flag, type badge, code (if applicable), and country. For India, include state suggestions (Goa, Karnataka, etc.).
- Data priority: Skyscanner Places or Kiwi Locations for air; GeoNames/ISO‑3166‑2 for states; curated lists for major rail/bus hubs; cache 24h.
- Behavior: suggest after 2 characters; ≥10 results; scrollable; arrow keys move; Enter selects; Esc closes; prefill From with user’s profile home base or IP geolocate.
- Save canonical place object with fields: type, name, code, state, country, lat, lng, timezone.
Acceptance:
- Typing “Goa” shows Goa (State) + Goa airports if any + India; typing “CA” shows California and Canada distinctly; suggestion latency <150 ms from cache.

Task 7 — Calendar range + presets (and fix white field contrast)
- Replace date inputs with a clean range picker overlay. Presets: Weekend, 3/5/7 days. Show readable chip “Thu → Mon • 4 nights”.
- Prevent past selections; timezone aware; keyboard accessible; no white backgrounds in dark theme.
Acceptance:
- Keyboard‑only selection works; reduced‑motion doesn’t break overlays; no contrast violations; displays length correctly.

Task 8 — Trip type selector (low‑noise)
- Chips: Adventure & Trekking (default), Business, Culture & History, Beach & Relaxation, Family, Food & Wine, Mixed.
- Selecting instantly updates a tiny on‑form preview card (fake day 1) to reassure users their selection changes the plan’s vibe.
Acceptance:
- Changing type swaps preview content in under 300 ms; chips have visible focus and selected states.

Task 9 — Stepper freedom (don’t force “Destination” first)
- Allow jumping to “Local Rides” or “Stay” first from the stepper. Preserve entered data. Show a soft warning if skipping required fields when trying to generate.
- Maintain breadcrumb logic and “Back” works predictably.
Acceptance:
- User can click into Local Rides first; no data loss on returning to Destination; generation is blocked only with clear inline messages.

Task 10 — Header/nav consistency + removal of extra nav items
- Ensure both logged‑out and logged‑in pages retain the same top bar spacing, hover states, and theme. Nav contains only Trips and Pricing.
- Replace “Pricing” page link target with the plan page we already have; remove “How it works” and “Features” from the header.
Acceptance:
- No double nav rows; no layout jump switching pages.

Task 11 — Copy, icons, gradients and micro‑motion polish
- Remove “AI” from all visible marketing copy.
- Replace generic icons with thin‑stroke travel set; unify sizes and stroke weights. Animate icon hover with a 150 ms gentle scale/tilt.
- Gradients: navy→teal only. No purple quirks anywhere.
Acceptance:
- Text audit finds no “AI” mentions on /; icons match style; hover transitions are snappy and consistent.

Task 12 — Accessibility and mobile pass
- Axe + manual audit: headings order, one H1 per page, descriptive links, alt text present, focus ring visible and not cut off by sticky headers.
- Android Chrome Pixel 6 and iOS Safari: hero not clipped; inputs readable; no keyboard overlay blocking fields; safe‑area insets honored.
Acceptance:
- Axe shows zero critical issues; all inputs reachable and usable on mobile.

Task 13 — Analytics event hooks (Phase 1 only)
- Fire events: landing_viewed, signin_started/completed, wizard_started, field_suggest_used, date_range_set, trip_type_selected, stepper_jump, plan_created (placeholder).
- Attach event properties (device, country (ip), referrer).
Acceptance:
- Events visible in analytics; no PII leakage in properties.

Task 14 — Performance guardrails
- Ensure hero LCP element is the H1. Preload serif font display=swap; preconnect to critical domains. Defer non‑critical scripts; limit route JS to ≤ 150 KB gz on / and /trips.
- Re‑run Lighthouse and record gains.
Acceptance:
- Mobile Lighthouse: Performance ≥ 85 on /, CLS < 0.1, LCP ≤ 2.0 s on 4G. /trips first interactive ≤ 2.5 s P95.

Task 15 — Regression sweep + sign‑off
- Click through all CTAs and flows created/changed. Verify no visual bugs, broken links, or theme mismatches.
- Record “after” screenshots and metrics next to “before.”
Acceptance:
- All green. BUGS_FIX.md closes Phase 1 with a summary table.

Specific issues to fix that the user flagged (map to tasks)
- Remove stock hero image and purple; center the title (Task 1 + 11).
- Add animated topo lines; navy→teal palette; travel icons orbit (Task 1).
- Replace loading spinner with bouncing GPS pin (Task 3).
- Keep signed in; no flicker; show FirstName, not email (Task 4 + 5).
- Wizard inputs: readable on dark; omnibox shows states/countries/cities/airports; India states included; fast keyboarding (Tasks 2 + 6).
- Calendar overlay with presets and proper contrast (Task 7).
- Don’t force Destination first; allow jumping to Local Rides/Stay (Task 9).
- Remove “How it works/Features” nav items; simplify (Task 10).
- Serif headings; consistent gradients and no purple (Tasks 2 + 11).

Tooling and how to run (Cloud must do this)
- Use headless browser with mobile emulation (Pixel 6) and desktop. Navigate interactions (typing in inputs, switching steps).
- Lighthouse and axe‑core for each primary route: /, /trips, /new.
- Network console capture for errors; verify no 4xx/5xx on critical assets.
- Analytics verifier to ensure events fire with expected props.
- GPT‑5 Nano for copy polishing and intent detection (e.g., mapping “Goa” → State in India vs City elsewhere).

Acceptance metrics to log in BUGS_FIX.md
- / (mobile): LCP ≤ 2.0 s, CLS < 0.1, Perf ≥ 85

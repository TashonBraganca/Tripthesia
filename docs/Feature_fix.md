# TRIPTHESIA TRAVEL PLANNER - COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE FIX & API INTEGRATION PLAN

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document serves as the master blueprint for transforming Tripthesia from a basic travel planner prototype into a production-ready, API-driven travel platform. The plan addresses critical UI/UX issues while implementing comprehensive travel APIs for flights, hotels, transport, and AI-powered recommendations.

**Project Scope:** Complete overhaul of UI components and integration of 15+ travel APIs  
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks for full implementation  
**Budget Estimate:** $200-500/month for API costs at production scale  
**Team Requirements:** 1 Full-stack developer + 1 QA engineer  

### CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE
1. **UI Layering Problems:** Dropdowns falling behind bento boxes due to z-index/stacking context issues
2. **Date Input UX:** Replace basic text inputs with professional ShadCN date/time pickers
3. **Display Formatting:** "Day 1" content visibility and formatting problems
4. **API Integration:** Complete lack of real travel data - all mock/static content
5. **Feature Completeness:** Missing road trip planning, real-time pricing, AI recommendations

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- All dropdowns and popovers render above other UI elements
- Professional date/time selection with calendar interface
- Complete travel search functionality with real API data
- AI-powered recommendations and itinerary generation
- Road trip planning with interactive maps
- Production-ready error handling and monitoring

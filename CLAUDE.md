## Previous Critical Restoration Work (Phase 9 - September 2025)

### **🚨 MAJOR UI/UX FIXES COMPLETED**
All critical user-reported issues have been resolved:

1. **✅ 6-Step Navigation System Restored**

- **Bundle Size**: /new page 157 kB (includes step navigation and auto-save)
- **Database Schema**: ✅ draft_trips table ready for migration
- **API Validation**: ✅ Zod schemas for data validation and type safety

### Database Schema Overview
- **users/profiles**: User data with subscription tiers (free/starter/pro)
- **trips**: User travel plans with destinations and budgets
- **itineraries**: AI-generated trip details with versioning
- **places**: Cached location data from external APIs
- **priceQuotes**: Flight/hotel pricing cache with expiration

### Authentication Flow
- Clerk handles all auth (sign-in/up redirects to `/trips`)
- Middleware protects routes and checks subscription tiers
- User profiles track usage limits and subscription status

### API Integration Pattern
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured JSON responses and error handling
- **Flight search**: Amadeus API → RapidAPI → Enhanced mock data fallback
- **Transport search**: Multi-modal integration (flights, trains, buses) with price tracking
- **Planning**: Advanced algorithms including TSP route optimization and conflict detection
- All external APIs have graceful degradation and caching
- Database operations use safe wrappers with availability checks

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Core functionality
DATABASE_URL=              # Neon PostgreSQL
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=   # Redis cache
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Enhanced features (optional)
AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=        # Flight pricing
RAPIDAPI_KEY=             # Flight search fallback
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=          # Payments
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=       # Places data
```

### Development Workflow
1. Always run `npm run typecheck` before committing
2. Test database changes locally before migration
3. API endpoints include comprehensive error handling and auth checks
4. Mock data fallbacks ensure app works without external API keys
5. Use Drizzle Studio to inspect database during development

### Code Patterns
- All API routes use Zod for input validation
- Database operations wrapped in `withDatabase()` for safety
- User subscription limits checked before paid features
- External API calls have timeout and retry logic
- All dates stored as timestamps, currency as enum (INR/USD)
- AI endpoints use structured JSON responses with comprehensive error handling
- Interactive components use Framer Motion for animations and drag-and-drop
- Route optimization uses Traveling Salesman Problem algorithms
- Real-time conflict detection for overlapping activities and travel time

### AI Integration Guidelines
- All AI endpoints require authentication and validate inputs with Zod
- Use GPT-4o-mini model with structured JSON response format
- Implement graceful degradation when AI service is unavailable
- Validate AI responses before returning to client
- Include user preferences and context for personalized results
- Handle rate limiting and API quotas appropriately
